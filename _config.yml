    description: I composed and produced this song (except the lyrics and vocal melodies which were written beautifully by Mitesh) and recorded along with my Ensemble mates Aditya Ahir (on the bass),  Sarvesh Raul (on guitar) and Kanishk Diwaker (on keys) and the results came out pretty well. This is the first time, I've recorded with my home drum kit setup ðŸ˜ƒand have tried to keep the music simple and groovy.

    description: I'm so excited to share this short composition that I wrote, in which I've tried to incorporate "minor" harmonic ideas (which I've been exploring for the past few months) with a bit of sampling, comping and syncopated grooves.
